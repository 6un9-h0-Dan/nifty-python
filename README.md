## Command Line Fu

*Let's add arguments to your Python scripts!*

* [click](https://github.com/pallets/click) - a Python package for creating beautiful command line interfaces in a composable way.
* [begins](https://github.com/aliles/begins) - quickly add command line arg parsing to your python scripts.
* [python-fire](https://github.com/google/python-fire) - a library for automatically generating command line interfaces (CLIs) from absolutely any Python object.

## Database

*Database related tech.*

* [tinydb](https://github.com/msiemens/tinydb) - TinyDB is a lightweight document oriented database optimized for your happiness :)

## General Purpose

*Stuff that seems useful. Generally.*

* [boltons](https://github.com/mahmoud/boltons) - Like builtins, but boltons. Constructs/recipes/snippets that would be handy in the standard library.
* [psutil](https://github.com/giampaolo/psutil) - Cross-platform lib for process and system monitoring in Python
* [towncrier](https://github.com/hawkowl/towncrier) - a utility to produce useful, summarised news files for your project

## Nifty Terminal

*Pimp out your terminal.*

* [Halo](https://github.com/ManrajGrover/halo) - Beautiful terminal spinners

* [parsedatetime](https://github.com/bear/parsedatetime) - Parse human-readable date/time strings
* [validus](https://github.com/shopnilsazal/validus) - A dead simple Python data validation library. They wrote regexes so I don't have to!

# Contributing

Please feel free to fork, but I am not accepting pull requests. I don't want this to be an awesome list.
It is the "cool, I'll look into it" list because I've heard about it recently. I expect it to change over time, not just by adding things.
